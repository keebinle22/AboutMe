    aboutMe: "My name is Kevin Le, and I have worked as a QA Analyst Contractor at RBC Wealth Management. During my time there, I designed and implemented over 500 automated functional and integration test scripts, using modeling-based tools like ConformIQ and Hexawise. I also worked with RBC’s keyword-driven automation framework to automate these test scripts, managing the test cases and results through Tricentis qTest. Recently, I achieved the Certified Tester Foundation Level from the ASTQB - ISTQB. I’m excited to continue expanding my testing knowledge and skills and am currently preparing for the Certified Tester Advanced Level Agile Technical Tester (CTAL-ATT).",
